/* PGP's S2K uses a bizarre processing-complexity specifier that specifies,
   in a very roundabout manner, the number of bytes hashed rather than the 
   iteration count.  In addition a number of PGP implementations specify
   ridiculous levels of hashing that make them more akin to a DoS attack 
   than any legitimate security measure.  In theory we could recalculate the 
   above define for an assumption of an 8-byte hash salt and and 8-byte 
   password to get a value of ( ( MAX_KEYSETUP_ITERATIONS * 16 ) / 64 ),
   with the '/ 64' term being present because what's specified is the value 
   without an additional * 64 multiplier that's added by the S2K mechanism 
   code, so we divide by 64 to account for this later scaling.  
   
   However in 2011 GPG raised its default hash specifier count from the
   GPG 1.x standard of 64K to over 2M (while still defaulting to the 15-
   year-old CAST5 for its block cipher, so it may use an obsolete 64-bit 
   crypto algorithm but at least it iterates the password hashing enough to 
   perform a DoS on anyone with an older machine) and some configurations go 
   even further and set it at 3,407,872.  Then at some point in 2017 the 
   Kleopatra GPG front-end raised the stakes even further with a value of 
   3,932,160, and then some time early in 2018 to 6,815,744 (all of these 
   values appear to be arbitrary, with or without the * 64 multiplier they 
   have no obvious significance).

   In addition to GPG's constantly-changing behaviour, PGP Desktop 9 
   (apparently) in its default config uses values up to 4M, and there's a 
   mutant GPG build used with loop-AES that uses 8M setup iterations for PGP 
   private keys.  Why this is used and why it writes PGP keys with this 
   setting is uncertain.

   The more extreme GPG iteration-count settings seem to be OS-specific
   fashion statements, Centos 8.4 has 39,845,888, Fedora has 58,720,256, 
   and Ubuntu goes all the way to 65,011,712, corresponding to a coded count
   of 0xFF, the highest that it's possible to set (see below).

   Unfortunately with these ludicrous-speed iteration counts there's no way
   to ensure any protection against DoS attacks due to such ridiculously 
   high iteration counts.  What eventually saves us is that it's physically
   impossible to encode more than 65M iterations, since the encoding is 
   poked into a single byte, defined as:
   
	count = (16 + (c & 15)) << ((c >> 4) + EXPBIAS);

   where c is an 8-bit value and EXPBIAS is 6.  This then evaluates to:

	= (16 + (0x0F)) << ((0xF0 >> 4) + EXPBIAS);
	= 31 << (15 + EXPBIAS);
	= 31 << 21
	= 65,011,712

   which means that we can see counts close to 2^26, working out to
   1,015,808 with the / 64 factor taken into account */

/* Various time values:

	MIN_TIME_VALUE: The minimum time value that's regarded as being a valid 
		time.  We have to allow dates slightly before the current time 
		because of things like backdated certificate revocations, as a rule 
		of thumb we allow a date up to two years in the past.
	
	MIN_STORED_TIME_VALUE: A somewhat more relaxed minimum time value used 
		when reading stored data like private keys, which can contain 
		associated certificates that have been hanging around for years.

	MAX_TIME_VALUE: The maximum time value that we can safely use while
		avoiding the Y2038 problem.  This issue only affects systens with 
		a 32-bit time_t so we only clip the time value on those systems.

	CURRENT_TIME_VALUE: An approximation of the current time with the 
		constraint that it's not after the current date.  Unfortunately we 
		can't use any preprocessor macros for this since __DATE__ and 
		__TIME__ are text strings rather than timestamps so we have to
		build it the hard way from the __DATE__ value, which ANSI defines as 
		"Mmm dd yyyy" with a space inserted if dd is less than 10.  The year 
		is relatively straightforward, the month is more complicated.  We 
		perform a match on the third letter of the month name, which has the 
		least collisions, and then disambiguate between Jan/Jun and Mar/Apr 
		to select the month days from a cumulative count of 31, 28, 31, 30, 
		31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, which is 0, 31, 59, 90, 120, 151, 
		181, 212, 243, 273, 304, 334, (365).  We ignore leap years since 
		it's only a single day and all we need is an approximate date, and 
		we backdate the calculated date by one month to deal with leap-year
		rounding errors.
		
		Note that some compilers aren't tough enough to evaluate this at
		compile time so we whitelist the compilers that can handle it and 
		for all others use an approximation.  In particular no version of 
		VC++ up to 2019 can handle it and different versions of gcc seem to 
		handle or not handle it at random for version 6 and above.  
		
		Also the calculation is typically done by the compiler rather than 
		the preprocessor so using it in the code works but using it in a 
		preprocessor expression, "#if CURRENT_TIME_VALUE < xxx", doesn't */

/* PGP's S2K uses a bizarre processing-complexity specifier that specifies,
   in a very roundabout manner, the number of bytes hashed rather than the 
   iteration count.  In addition a number of PGP implementations specify
   ridiculous levels of hashing that make them more akin to a DoS attack 
   than any legitimate security measure.  In theory we could recalculate the 
   above define for an assumption of an 8-byte hash salt and and 8-byte 
   password to get a value of ( ( MAX_KEYSETUP_ITERATIONS * 16 ) / 64 ),
   with the '/ 64' term being present because what's specified is the value 
   without an additional * 64 multiplier that's added by the S2K mechanism 
   code, so we divide by 64 to account for this later scaling.  
   
   However in 2011 GPG raised its default hash specifier count from the
   GPG 1.x standard of 64K to over 2M (while still defaulting to the 15-
   year-old CAST5 for its block cipher, so it may use an obsolete 64-bit 
   crypto algorithm but at least it iterates the password hashing enough to 
   perform a DoS on anyone with an older machine) and some configurations go 
   even further and set it at 3,407,872.  Then at some point in 2017 the 
   Kleopatra GPG front-end raised the stakes even further with a value of 
   3,932,160, and then some time early in 2018 to 6,815,744 (all of these 
   values appear to be arbitrary, with or without the * 64 multiplier they 
   have no obvious significance).

   In addition to GPG's constantly-changing behaviour, PGP Desktop 9 
   (apparently) in its default config uses values up to 4M, and there's a 
   mutant GPG build used with loop-AES that uses 8M setup iterations for PGP 
   private keys.  Why this is used and why it writes PGP keys with this 
   setting is uncertain.

   The more extreme GPG iteration-count settings seem to be OS-specific
   fashion statements, Centos 8.4 has 39,845,888, Fedora has 58,720,256, 
   and Ubuntu goes all the way to 65,011,712, corresponding to a coded count
   of 0xFF, the highest that it's possible to set (see below).

   Unfortunately with these ludicrous-speed iteration counts there's no way
   to ensure any protection against DoS attacks due to such ridiculously 
   high iteration counts.  What eventually saves us is that it's physically
   impossible to encode more than 65M iterations, since the encoding is 
   poked into a single byte, defined as:
   
	count = (16 + (c & 15)) << ((c >> 4) + EXPBIAS);

   where c is an 8-bit value and EXPBIAS is 6.  This then evaluates to:

	= (16 + (0x0F)) << ((0xF0 >> 4) + EXPBIAS);
	= 31 << (15 + EXPBIAS);
	= 31 << 21
	= 65,011,712

   which means that we can see counts close to 2^26, working out to
   1,015,808 with the / 64 factor taken into account */

/* Various time values:

	MIN_TIME_VALUE: The minimum time value that's regarded as being a valid 
		time.  We have to allow dates slightly before the current time 
		because of things like backdated certificate revocations, as a rule 
		of thumb we allow a date up to two years in the past.
	
	MIN_STORED_TIME_VALUE: A somewhat more relaxed minimum time value used 
		when reading stored data like private keys, which can contain 
		associated certificates that have been hanging around for years.

	MAX_TIME_VALUE: The maximum time value that we can safely use while
		avoiding the Y2038 problem.  This issue only affects systens with 
		a 32-bit time_t so we only clip the time value on those systems.

	CURRENT_TIME_VALUE: An approximation of the current time with the 
		constraint that it's not after the current date.  Unfortunately we 
		can't use any preprocessor macros for this since __DATE__ and 
		__TIME__ are text strings rather than timestamps so we have to
		build it the hard way from the __DATE__ value, which ANSI defines as 
		"Mmm dd yyyy" with a space inserted if dd is less than 10.  The year 
		is relatively straightforward, the month is more complicated.  We 
		perform a match on the third letter of the month name, which has the 
		least collisions, and then disambiguate between Jan/Jun and Mar/Apr 
		to select the month days from a cumulative count of 31, 28, 31, 30, 
		31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, which is 0, 31, 59, 90, 120, 151, 
		181, 212, 243, 273, 304, 334, (365).  We ignore leap years since 
		it's only a single day and all we need is an approximate date, and 
		we backdate the calculated date by one month to deal with leap-year
		rounding errors.
		
		Note that some compilers aren't tough enough to evaluate this at
		compile time so we whitelist the compilers that can handle it and 
		for all others use an approximation.  In particular no version of 
		VC++ up to 2019 can handle it and different versions of gcc seem to 
		handle or not handle it at random for version 6 and above.  
		
		Also the calculation is typically done by the compiler rather than 
		the preprocessor so using it in the code works but using it in a 
		preprocessor expression, "#if CURRENT_TIME_VALUE < xxx", doesn't */
